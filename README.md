Network Scanning and Traffic Analysis Tool
Project Overview
This project is a network scanning and traffic analysis toolkit built using Python and the Scapy library. It performs tasks such as:
Discovering active hosts on a subnet.
Capturing and logging network traffic.
Generating different types of packets (ICMP, TCP, UDP).
Measuring key network performance metrics like data rate, throughput, latency, and jitter.
The tool is designed for educational purposes, basic network exploration, and performance evaluation.

Features:
  ARP Network Scanning: Find all active devices on a specified subnet.
  Traffic Sniffing & Logging: Capture and log TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets related to a specific IP.
  Traffic Generation: Send ICMP, TCP, and UDP packets to simulate network traffic.
  Network Performance Measurement: Calculate data rate, throughput, latency, and jitter.
  CSV Logging: All captured packets and performance metrics are saved to CSV files for later analysis.
